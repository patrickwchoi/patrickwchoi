# Hello, Welcome to Patrick's Github!

### About me

I am a fullstack software engineer with a preference towards frontend development and expertise in React-Redux, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS. My skills and experience have been honed through various personal and professional projects, including a Tumblr fullstack clone built with a Rails backend and React-Redux frontend. I am always eager to take on new challenges and am excited to continue growing as a developer.
